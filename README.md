## Background/requirements (what you need to know)

### Backend:

1. [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp) - Language used for writing the web API.
2. [Databases (MySQL)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) - Used to store user authentication information.
3. [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) - Used to manage the database.
4. Web API. - Used to communicate with the frontend clients (people).
5. [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp). - A specific notation used for web/HTTP request data transfer between the backend and frontend.
6. HTTP Requests (Headers, Body), responses, and response codes. - The protocol used for used for data communication between the backend (server) and frontend (browser).
7. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - Easy UI used to quickly test that your backend endpoints work as expected.

### Frontend:

1. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
2. [Super basic CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
3. [JavaScript requests & DOM manipulation basics](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - All needed is how to send requests and receive responses, and add and remove elements from/into the DOM. Some functions that can be used for this would be ".appendChild()", ".remove()". Then, "fetch" would be used for HTTP requests.
